# TFS Redux
Team Fortress Sandbox Redux. A totally rewritten and improved version of the original TFS plugin developed by KTM.\
IN ALPHA, PLEASE DON'T ACTUALLY USE YET.

CREDITS:
- KTM: He coded the original TFS Plugin that was developed for the {SuN} and {SuN} Revived servers.
- chundo: His 'Help Menu' plugin helped me learn how to use config files to create menus.
- Xeon: Owner of Neogenesis Network. Although he didn't help me in this project, he's helped me in the past with my development adventures. This guy is awesome.
- The {SuN} Community and Staff: For being part of the best gaming community I've ever been in. ALL of you are awesome!

Improvements upon the origin:
