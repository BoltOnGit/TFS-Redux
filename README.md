# TFS Redux
Team Fortress Sandbox Redux. A rewritten and improved version of the original TFS plugin developed by KTM.


## Features (so far):
```
- Spawn in props! Edit the prop list by editing proplist.cfg.
- Move and rotate props around via the Manipulate menu!
- Edit various properties of props, such as rotation, color, collision, transparency, saturation, and size with the Edit menu!
- Delete a single prop you are looking at, or clear all of your props at once!
- Cvar that sets everyone's personal prop limit!: sm_tfs_proplimit (def. 50)
- TFS Admin Menu
- Player collision check after prop manipulation. This stops propblocking
```

## To do:
```
- Add more props to proplist.cfg (event props, weapon mdls, hat mdls, etc)
- Personal player settings (manipulate beam color, POSSIBLE different entity types such as prop_physics, etc)
- Dead/Spec Player Checks
- Support for no build zones (prob with named trigger_multiple)
- Another config file for setting things such as sounds, manipulation beam textures, etc
```
