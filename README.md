# TFS Redux
Team Fortress Sandbox Redux. A totally rewritten and improved version of the original TFS plugin developed by KTM.\
IN ALPHA, PLEASE DON'T ACTUALLY USE YET.

## Features (so far):
```
- Spawn in props! Edit the prop list by editing PropMenu.cfg.
- Move and rotate props around via the Manipulate menu!
```



## Improvements upon the original:
```
- No more hardcoded prop lists. Now, you can add and remove props via PropMenu.cfg
- TFS Admin Menu (WIP)
- Now public
- More coming soon.
```
